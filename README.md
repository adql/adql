`functional programming ‚ö° types ‚ö° Emacs ‚ö° ideas`

I've been programming since a very young age (does `90 GOTO 20` ring a bell?). Recently I've begun to take it more ‚Äúseriously‚Äù, by which I mean ‚Äúwith more fun‚Äù.

I currently work on [FakeWorld](https://github.com/adql/fakeworld/), a full-stack [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) implementation with a twist: the frontend is actually a TUI build with [Brick](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/brick)! It's a fun learning project to enhance my Haskell skills in a somewhat unconventional way while diving into libraries such as [Servant](https://www.servant.dev/).

I also have some front-end and other more-or-less silly project üëá. See [my website](https://amirdekel.com/coding.html) for a summary.
