`functional programming ‚ö° types ‚ö° Emacs ‚ö° ideas`

I've been programming since a very young age (does `90 GOTO 20` ring a bell?). Recently I've begun to take it more ‚Äúseriously‚Äù, by which I mean ‚Äúwith more fun‚Äù.

#### Things I currently do
- Projects
  - [Spure](https://adql.github.io/spure) [[src](https://github.com/adql/spure) ¬∑ _PureScript+React_]: Most minimal no-regrets editor (_work in progress_)
  - Moonad [[src](https://github.com/adql/Moonad) ¬∑ _Haskell_]: Interpreter for the [COW](https://bigzaphod.github.io/COW/) joke language (_work in progress_)
  - [Purelife](https://adql.github.io/purelife/) [[src](https://github.com/adql/purelife) ¬∑ _PureScript+React_]: Conway's Game of Life implementation (_work in progress_)
  
##### I should pay more attention to

- Org Roam Kasten [[src](https://github.com/adql/org-roam-kasten) ¬∑ Emacs Lisp]: A browser for [Org-roam](https://www.orgroam.com/)

#### Older creative stuff

- [Nature of Code](https://adql.github.io/nature-of-code-cw/) [[src](https://github.com/adql/nature-of-code-cw) ¬∑ JavaScript+p5.js]: Coursework for [Kadenze course](https://www.kadenze.com/certificates/verified/EG8ZQTX4)
- [Creative coding](https://openprocessing.org/user/28888) [Processing]: A small selection of older sketches
